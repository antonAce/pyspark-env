# Environment setup for Apache Spark project

This template is a personal collection of boilerplate code and utility scripts for a Python project with Apache Spark. I personally do not recommend using this script for anyone else, **especially in production**, as I am not a professional engineer and primarily use this repository to test out random ideas and experiments.

## Structure

 - [Dataset files](./data)
 - [Jupyter notebooks](./ipynb)
 - [Project source code](./src)
 - [Project unit tests](./test)
 - [Common utility scripts](./util)
    - [General purpose utilities](./util/common)
    - [Machine learning](./util/ml)
    - [Natural language processing](./util/nlp)

## Getting started

*TODO:* add a Makefile with setup scripts.

## Contributing

It's a personal project, after all, but I would appreciate any suggestions.

## Features

Use it to instantly create Pyspark environment for testing purposes.

## License

No license.
